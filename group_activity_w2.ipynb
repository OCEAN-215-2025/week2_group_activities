    "You will work in groups of 3-4 and work on this exercise together, submitting a single notebook file at the end of the class period. You will work together on exercises in the same groups each Thursday for the next several weeks. Introduce yourselves and and decide among yourselves which member will upload the completed notebook to Gradescope. _Make sure that everyone takes turn being the \"Uploader\" such that you cannot upload the final code two weeks in a row._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "Each question will be timed to ensure that everyone gets to work on at least a part of every question. Group activities are not graded by completeness or correctness, but by effort. We will be breaking down each question in the following order:  \n",
    "1. Independent work \n",
    "2. Group work and discussion on coding question\n",
    "3. Group work and discussion on reflection questions\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome and encouraged to communicate with other groups and the teaching team when you feel stuck on a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we will be grading based best practices in coding. These include: \n",
    "1) Variables are used to store objects\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make sure that your variable names are meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Format your code consistently\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Add comments to document your intention, as well as (less commonly) tricky implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Documenting help from outside sources, such as from other groups or online documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) Final notebook fully runs from start to finish. A good way to check this is restarting the kernel and fully running through all the cells to check for any errors."

    "For oceanic surface currents with long timescales that travel large distances (like the gulf stream), the direction of the net transport is actually 90Â° to the right of the surface winds in the northern hemisphere.
